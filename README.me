#Cesc challenge

Hello.

Instructions:

How to use it.

How to run the tests.


Caveats:

Stubs on tests

Not testing for ErrorTypes.

Why not symfony?

Nop "dev" part at composer.json (intention to be it the most lightweight possible)


I didn't pay much attention to phpunit version.

I hope I understood teh challenge all right, but in any case you can more or less
have an idea of how I work.
